this project aims to develop a sign language detection system that translates hand gestures into text 
or speech. The system is designed to assist in communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing 
community by recognizing and interpreting signs corresponding to the alphabet.

Aim of the project: 
1. Create a sign language detection system for text or speech translation. 
2. Capture alphabet signs using keyboard keys. 
3. Achieve accurate gesture recognition. 
4. Enable real-time processing. 
5. Ensure user-friendly interaction and data security.
